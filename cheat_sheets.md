Identifies how the route was learned (C = connected, L = local, S = static, D = EIGRP) | Identifies the address of the remote network | Identifies the trustworthiness of the route source | Identifies the value assigned to reach the remote network. Lower values indicate preferred routes | Identifies the IPv4 address of the next router to forward the packet to | Identifies from when the route was last heard | Identifies the exit interface to use to forward a packet toward the final destination
